= DEVELOPERS SCROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN BEFORE MODIFYING CODE =
= PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU SEE AN ERROR, TY! =

Windows Users:
- Install Python 3 
- Open up command prompt and run "-m pip install -U pip"
- Run "pip install pygame" in the same window.
- Run "pip install pgzero" in the same window too
- Copy the location of the file "coin.py".
- Go back to command prompt and do "pgzrun <filelocation>"
- You're all good to go, you should see a small screen popup with the game!



Mac Users:
- Install Homebrew if you haven't already
	- Open up terminal and run: "ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"


- Then run "brew install python3" in a terminal window.
- Also run "brew install sdl sdl_mixer sdl_sound sdl_ttf" in the same window.
- Afterwards, run "pip3 install pygame", and then "pip3 install pgzero".
- Now, right click on "coin.py" in the finder application, and select copy path.

- Open a terminal window and type "pgzrun <filelocation>"
- Replace filelocation with the text you copied.



Linux Users:
- I'm not actually sure how to run it on linux, I'm guessing it would be similar to the instructiosn that Mac users have to follow.


DEVELOPERS:
Any variables that are in CAPS means, that you shouldn't mess around with those variables.

I've added comments where it's needed, so please read them.

Please give credit :)
